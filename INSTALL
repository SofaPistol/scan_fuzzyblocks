scan_fuzzyblocks installation instructions

general steps (see below for details)
1. install prerequisites
2. download scan_fuzzyblocks plugin
3. run install script

1. install prerequisites
   install bulk_extractor with whatever dependencies nessecary, detailed instructions here:
    https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor/wiki/Installing-bulk_extractor
   
   what worked for me on ubuntu, some packages might not even be needed:
    sudo apt-get install gcc g++ flex libewf-dev libssl-dev git libtool libtool-bin autoconf automake libexpat1 libexpat1-dev libxml2-dev libtre-dev
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor.git
    cd bulk_extractor
    sh bootstrap.sh
    ./configure

   install an older version of googles protobuf library, which is needed by sdhash:
    https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases/tag/v2.5.0
    tar -zxvf protobuf-2.5.0.tar.gz
    cd protobuf-2.5.0
    (autoreconf -i)     # if a configure error occurs
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

   check if protobuf is in the library path, so that applications can find it: 
    protoc --version
   if it fails add the protobuf lib dir to the ld path e.g.:
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib   # temporary
    sudo ldconfig /usr/local/lib            # permanently

2. download scan_fuzzyblocks plugin
    (insert text here)

3. run install script
   the script builds sdhash, mrshv2 and the plugin and installs the plugin to '/usr/local/lib/bulk_extractor',
   which is one of the default paths where bulk_extractor looks for plugins
   run the script like this:
    BE_ABS_PATH=path/to/bulk_extractor ./fuz-install
   BE_ABS_PATH (default=~/bulk_extractor) tells the script the location to bulk_extractor for certain dependecies

   if you wish to install the plugin somewhere else, build it manually:
    cd sdhash
    make
    cd mrshv2
    make
    cd scan_fuzzyblocks
    make BE_ABS_PATH=path/to/bulk_extractor
   then copy the plugin .so file to the desired location and
   add its destination to the bulk_extractor BE_PATH environment variable, so bulk_extractor knows how to find it e.g.:
    export BE_PATH=path/to/plugin	                            # temporary
    appending above line to a startup script like ~/.profile    # permanently
    
finally run bulk_extractor without options and check if fuzzyblocks is listed under 'scanners disabled by default'
refer to MANUAL for information on using the plugin
