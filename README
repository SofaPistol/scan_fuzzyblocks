Scan_fuzzyblocks is a bulk_extractor scanner plugin for generating and
comparing blockwise similarity hashes. The plugin is designed for comparing
blocks of arbitrary inputs like files or disk images to identify and locate
fragments of data that share similarities. Its original use case is to scan
bulks of data on the byte level for different versions of files and pinpoint
their locations.

It uses the implementations of the similarity hashing / approximate matching
schemes ssdeep, sdhash and mrshv2, but deviates from them in certain aspects.
Hashes are generated on a per-block basis, meaning that every hashed block
(e.g. sector) of the input has its own similarity hash including a name that
tracks the position of the block via the bulk_extractor forensic path.
While sdhash already provides the ability to generate block hashes,
a comparision can only yield information if the compared data shares
commonalities, e.g. a variation of a file is present on a drive.
By default it cannot answer how many similar files are present and where they
are located. Scan_fuzzyblocks aims to fill this gap. A comparision results in
a list of compared blocks and corresponding similarity scores, where every
block of the first set (e.g. file) is compared against every block of the
second set (e.g. drive). Each block is identifiable and traceable by its
forensic path.

The bulk_extractor infrastructure allows the plugin to operate on the byte
level and forgo OS/filesystem structures, scan unallocated blocks as well as
certain compressed or encoded data and make use of heavy CPU parallelization.
